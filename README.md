# Cromium

An simple CDP (Chrome Devtools Protocol) client, made for testing, scraping, screenshot and html to pdf.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cromium:
       github: confact/cromium
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "cromium"
```

### Settings

Default is local chromium executable. Cromium is using Crystal's `Process`, which looks for `chrome` in absolute path, path relative to pwd, or in path.

If you want to use a remote address and turn off the process:
```
Cromium.remote = true
Cromium.endpoint = "https://chrome.browserless.io/sdsdsdfsd"
```

If you want to run your chromium process on a specific port, instead of default 9222, just set the endpoint, but keep remote as `false`
```
Cromium.endpoint = "http://localhost:9000"
```
